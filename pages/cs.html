    <div id="library">
    <h1>Library Database</h1>
    	<p>

    		<br><b>Tools:</b> MySQL, Python, Flask, Docker, html, css
			<br> Design of a mock Library database system using SQL. A Flask app pulls book and author
			data from a MySQL database and displays the information to the user via a web application.
			Users are able to search the database by title, author, or ISBN number. The app also alows 
			the user to create an account and place a hold on a title.

    <h1>Spanish Readability Classifier</h1>
    	<p>
    		<a href="cs/spanish.html">More Details</a>			
			<br><b>Tools:</b> Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, spaCy
			<br> For Spanish language educators and learners, it would be beneficial to have 
			a corpus of online Spanish texts that can be organized based on the difficulilty of
			the text to a new Spanish learner. This project explores the various features that 
			contribute to Spanish text readability and builds a model to predict the readability of 
			a given text.

    <h1>Word Search Generator</h1>
    	<p>

    		<br><a href="cs/word_search.html">More Details</a>
			<br><b>Tools:</b> Python, tkinter, reportlab, cv2 (OpenCV), numpy, PIL, pyPDF2 
			<br> This is a GUI for a word search generator/creation tool. Users can create a list of
			words and define the size and shape of the puzzle. Then they can either place the words
			in the puzzle manually or automatically and generate the rest of the letters around the 
			words. Once the word search has been created, it can be exported as a pdf.

    		<br><a href="cs/cryptography.html">More Details</a>
			<br><b>Tools:</b> Python, numpy
			<br> Implementation of various ciphers in Python that were covered in an 
			Undergrad Cryptography class. Shift Ciphers, Vigenere Ciphers, Substitution Ciphers, 
			and Affine Ciphers are implemented.
