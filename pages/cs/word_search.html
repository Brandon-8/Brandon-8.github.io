    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This is a GUI for a word search generator/creation tool built using Python and 
        tkinter. Users can create a list of words and define the size and shape of the puzzle. 
        Then they can either place the words in the puzzle manually or automatically and generate 
        the rest of the letters around the words. Once the word search has been created, it can 
        be exported as a pdf.
    <br><br><b>Tools:</b> Python, tkinter, reportlab, cv2 (OpenCV), numpy, PIL, pyPDF2
