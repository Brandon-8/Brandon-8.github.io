    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Implementation of various ciphers in Python that were covered in an Undergrad Cryptography class.
      Shift Ciphers, Vigenere Ciphers, Substitution Ciphers, and Affine Ciphers are implemented. Note:
      the assumption is that messages are using a standard English alphabet.

    <h1>Shift Cipher</h1>
    <p>
      A Shift Cipher is a basic cipher that shifts all letters in the message by certain value (called the key)
      to a subsequent letter in the alphabet. The Caesar Cipher is the case where the key is 3.
      <br><br>
      In addition to basic functions to encrypt and decrpyt a given messages, using the key value, there are 
      to methods to crack a Shift cipher when the key value is unknown. The first is a brute force approach where
      every possible key (0-25 in the case of standard alphabet) is tested on the encrypted message. All the 
      potential decrypted messages are compared to a U.S. dictionary to see how closely it aligns with the English language
      The most likely candidates for the decrypted message are returned to the user. 
      <br><br>
      The code for this is shown below.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      def shift_crack_brute_force(self, ciphertext, valid_percent, one_result=False):
              possible_decrpyt = [] # may be possible to get more than one potential plaintext
              length = len(self.alphabet)
              # Brute Force by checking every possible shift value
              for ii in range(length):
                  self.set_key(ii)
                  poss = self.decrypt(ciphertext)

                  if poss == None:
                      return None
                  
                  # check if the decrypted text is english
                  valid = check_text(poss)
                  res = {'Plaintext': poss, 'Shift Value': ii, 'Valid': valid}
                  if one_result and valid >= valid_percent:
                      return res
                  possible_decrpyt.append(res)  
              
              self.set_key(None)
              return possible_decrpyt
    </pre></code>
    <p>
      The second method to crack a Shift Cipher is by leveraging letter frequencies. The most common
      letter in the English language is the letter 'e'. Knowing this, given an encrypted message that is 
      sufficiently long, the most freqent letter in the encrypted message likely maps to the letter 'e' (or
      another high frequency letter) and thus the key value can be determined.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="vigenere">
    <h1>Vigenere Cipher</h1>
    <p>
      The Vigenere Cipher is an evolution of the Shift Cipher where each letter is shifted by a different amount
      as opposed to the Shift Cipher where every letter is shifted by the same amount.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="substitution">
  <h1>Substitution Cipher</h1>
  <p>
    A Substitution Cipher is when one letter of a text is replaced by a different letter. For example: every 'e' in
    the plaintext becomes 'x' in the encrypted message. This is different than a Vigenere Cipher as the same letter
    in a Vigenere Cipher may map to different letters in the encrypted message depending on the key. The best way to
    crak a Substitution Cipher is through a frequency analysis.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div id="affine">
  <h1>Affine Cipher</h1>
  <p>
    An Affine Cipher is a substitution Cipher where the key is represented by a linear function: f = Ax + B. Each 
    letter encrypts to exactly one other letter, making it essentially a Substitution Cipher governed by a particular
    rule to determine the mapping. This means it has the weaknesses of a Substitution Cipher and can be cracked with
     a frequency analysis or by brute forcing every possible value of A and B.
